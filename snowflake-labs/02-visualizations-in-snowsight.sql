-- 2.0.0   Visualizations in Snowsight
--         The purpose of this lab is to show you how to use the visualization
--         features and tools available in Snowsight. Specifically, you’ll learn
--         how to leverage our built-in contextual statistics columns in order
--         to gain quick insights into data. Also, you’ll learn how to create a
--         dashboard from an existing query.
--         - How to create a dashboard from a worksheet
--         - How to use ad-hoc filters to get insights into data
--         - How to add tiles to a dashboard
--         - How to share a dashboard
--         Snowbear Air is interested in seeing a year-by-year summary of gross
--         sales. You’ve been asked to write a query with a graph and share it
--         via a Snowflake dashboard. You’ve decided to use the
--         PROMO_CATALOG_SALES schema to accomplish your task.
--         HOW TO COMPLETE THIS LAB
--         In the previous, lab you may have used the SQL code file for that lab
--         to create a new worksheet and then just run the code provided within
--         that worksheet. That approach will be modified a bit for this lab due
--         to the nature of what you will be doing.
--         If you decide to use the SQL file to do this lab instead of the
--         workbook PDF, note that there is a step in this lab that creates a
--         dashboard from your worksheet. Once you do that step, you will lose
--         access to the worksheet (and, thus, the instructions). Because of
--         this, you will need to use the PDF workbook to complete this lab. The
--         best way to complete this lab is to use the PDF workbook instructions
--         for the entire lab from start to finish.
--         Let’s get started!

-- 2.1.0   Set Up for the Lab

-- 2.1.1   Using skills you’ve already learned, create a new folder called
--         Visualizations.

-- 2.1.2   Create a worksheet inside the Visualizations folder.
--         Click the down arrow just to the right of your folder name, and
--         select Create Worksheet from SQL File. Navigate to the lab file and
--         load it.

-- 2.1.3   Rename the worksheet to Dashboard Data.
--         Click the down arrow just to the right of your worksheet’s default
--         name (which is the name of the SQL file). Remove the default name and
--         name your worksheet Dashboard Data.

-- 2.1.4   Set the context by executing the statements below in your worksheet:
--         If you’re following along in your workbook PDF, you’ll notice that
--         the file is filled with commented instructions. Just scroll down to
--         the context commands shown below and execute them.

USE ROLE TRAINING_ROLE;
USE SCHEMA SNOWBEARAIR_DB.PROMO_CATALOG_SALES;
CREATE WAREHOUSE IF NOT EXISTS HYENA_wh;
USE WAREHOUSE HYENA_WH;


-- 2.1.5   Run the query below:

SELECT 
  YEAR(o.o_orderdate) AS year,
  SUM(l.l_extendedprice) AS sum_gross_revenue
        
FROM
        CUSTOMER C
        INNER JOIN ORDERS O ON C.C_CUSTKEY = O.O_CUSTKEY
        INNER JOIN LINEITEM L ON O.O_ORDERKEY = L.L_ORDERKEY

GROUP BY year
ORDER BY year;

--         You should see the results below:

-- 2.1.6   Format the YEAR column.
--         Notice that both columns in the result have commas in them - but you
--         don’t want commas in the YEAR column. Hover your mouse over the
--         column name, and click the ellipsis (three dots) that appear on the
--         left side of the column header. A formatting panel will appear. Click
--         the picture of the comma to remove commas from the values in the
--         column, as shown below:
--         You can click it again to put the commas back. You can also play with
--         the other options to see what they do. When you are done, you should
--         have no commas or decimal values in the YEAR column.

-- 2.2.0   Analyze the Results and Data

-- 2.2.1   Review the Query Details pane.
--         To the right of your query result, you will see a Query Details pane.
--         Click on that pane (shown below) to see more information, such as the
--         role and virtual warehouse used by the query.

-- 2.2.2   View contextual statistics.
--         Scroll down. Below the Query Details pane, you will see contextual
--         statistics for the two columns in your table: one pane labeled YEAR
--         and the other labeled SUM_GROSS_REVENUE. The contextual statistics,
--         one for each column returned by the query, can be used interactively
--         as filters on the query result.

-- 2.2.3   Activate the YEAR filter.
--         Click on the YEAR filter in the contextual statistics pane. This will
--         also highlight the YEAR column in the query results, as shown below:

-- 2.2.4   Click on the leftmost column in the graph.
--         Now the results should be filtered for 2012 only:

-- 2.2.5   Select 2012 and 2013.
--         Note the two oval selectors beneath the chosen column in the filter’s
--         graph. Click, hold, and drag the right-most selector to include both
--         2012 and 2013. Your filter should now appear as shown below:
--         Now click different bars, or select any combination of multiple bars
--         to see how the filter changes the data shown.

-- 2.2.6   Clear the filter.
--         Click Clear filter at the top of the statistics pane.
--         This will return it to its unfiltered state.

-- 2.2.7   Close the filter.
--         Click the X in the upper right corner of the panel. This will clear
--         the column selected, and you should see the Query Details pane and
--         the YEAR and SUM_GROSS_REVENUE filters.

-- 2.2.8   Click the SUM_GROSS_REVENUE filter.
--         The filter should appear as below. Click each bar in the graph and
--         observe how the data is filtered. Clicking between the bars will
--         display the following message: Query produced no results. That’s
--         because there is a gap between the value in the left-most bar and the
--         value in the right-most bar.

-- 2.2.9   Clear and close the filter.
--         Click Clear filter and then the X to close the filter.

-- 2.3.0   Create a Dashboard
--         You can create a dashboard either from the dashboard area or by
--         moving an existing worksheet to the dashboard area. The next step
--         will move your worksheet out of the worksheet area into the dashboard
--         area, so you will need access to the PDF for the instructions that
--         follow.
--         Creating a dashboard from an existing worksheet moves the worksheet
--         to the dashboard area (so it will no longer appear in your worksheets
--         area). If you’ve been relying on the instructions in the SQL file,
--         you will lose access to those instructions once you move the existing
--         worksheet to a new dashboard. If you have not been using your PDF
--         workbook thus far, open it now for the rest of the instructions.

-- 2.3.1   Move your worksheet to the dashboard area.
--         Click the arrow to the right of the worksheet name, and navigate to
--         Move to and then + New Dashboard.

-- 2.3.2   Name the dashboard HYENA Gross Sales.
--         In the pop-up box that appears, enter your user name followed by
--         Gross Sales as the dashboard name, and click Create Dashboard.
--         You will now see the worksheet that has been moved to the Dashboard
--         area.
--         The worksheet will contain the instructions for this lab, but don’t
--         worry. Because they are commented out, they won’t affect the result
--         of your query, nor will they cause an error.

-- 2.3.3   Rename the worksheet.
--         The name of the worksheet (shown at the top) will become the name of
--         the tile in your dashboard. Change the name to Gross Sales Data.

-- 2.3.4   Click - Return to HYENA Gross Sales in the upper left corner.
--         You should now see a dashboard tile that contains the results of the
--         query.
--         Tiles are used to present data or graphs in a dashboard.

-- 2.4.0   Add Tiles to a Dashboard
--         There are several ways to add a tile to an existing dashboard. You
--         can create a new tile from scratch, or you can duplicate an existing
--         tile to modify its query. Or, if you have a tile that contains
--         numeric data and you want to create a graph of that data, you can
--         simply edit the query for that tile and press the Chart button. We
--         are going to use the third method since our new tile will just be a
--         different representation of the same data.

-- 2.4.1   Create a new tile.
--         In your dashboard, click the ellipsis (three dots) that appears in
--         the upper far right corner of your existing tile (not dashboard) and
--         select Edit Query. You will be taken back to the original query with
--         the query result.

-- 2.4.2   Press the Chart button just below the SQL and just above the query
--         results.
--         A line graph will be displayed by default:

-- 2.4.3   Click - Return to HYENA Gross Sales in the upper left.
--         You should now see a completed dashboard like the one shown below:

-- 2.4.4   Reposition the graph tile above the data tile.
--         Click, hold and drag the graph tile. When you see a blue cursor
--         appear just above the tile with the gross sales table, release the
--         mouse key.
--         Your dashboard should now appear as it does below:

-- 2.5.0   Share Your Dashboard

-- 2.5.1   Click the Share button in the upper-right corner.
--         In this dialog box, you can search for someone and invite them to
--         view and use this dashboard.

-- 2.5.2   Enter Instructor1 as the user to share with.

-- 2.5.3   Set permissions to View + run.
--         Click the down arrow to the right of the user name, and select View +
--         run. Then click Done. You have now shared your dashboard.

-- 2.6.0   Key Takeaways
--         - While conducting ad-hoc analyses, you can use filters to gain
--         insights into your data.
--         - You can create dashboards out of existing worksheets.
--         - Snowflake makes it super-easy to share worksheets with colleagues.
